A replacement for my Beosound Essence, which, unlike the original, sparks joy.

Talks to a Beo(master|system|sound) via a Lintronic TT455-RT-238.

TODO:

* Two way communication with the Beomaster, so that we don't turn it off if it's playing something.
* Beosound Essence remote control connectivity somehow.
* Use librespot directly, instead of spotifyd?
